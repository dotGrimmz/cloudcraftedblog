      "Stars and Strikes didnt have much to offer culinary wise. The food was cold and didnt taste well at all. We ordered mozzarella sticks and they were no better than what you would get out of a freezer at the local kroger but we paid for it so it got eaten. The arcade however was excellent. Guitar Hero was my favorite since it was the only thing I stood a chance in compeitivly against Angel. She beat me in blowling, hoops, and just about anything that was compeitive. The bumper cars section seemed too small for our taste so we opted out. All and all we would return just with full stomaches and a fully blown pre game at the house.",

We ordered the friend lobster tail and lump crab cakes. The lobster tail was just tiny, unseasoned and did we mention it was only half a tail? for 13 dollars. The amount of salt in the crab cakes made them unedible, soggy, and just bad all together. Its a bar .. so next time.. were ordering wings for SURE!",
