The food was cold and didnt taste well at all. We ordered mozzarella sticks and they were no better than what you would get out of a freezer at the local kroger but we paid for it so it got eaten. The arcade however was excellent. Guitar Hero was my favorite since it was the only thing I stood a chance in compeitivly against Angel. She beat me in blowling, hoops, and just about anything that was compeitive. The bumper cars section seemed too small for our taste so we opted out. All and all we would return just with full stomaches and a fully blown pre game at the house.",
